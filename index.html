        <p>What is the box model: a container that consists of multiple different properties.
          <ol>
            <li>content</li>
            <li>padding</li>
            <li>border</li>
            <li>margin</li>
          </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="./CSS SImp/index.html">CSS Simp</a>
          <h3>box sizing:</h3> content-box= contents is the same as the width and height. border-box= boder + padding + content. The window will shrink the content to fit in height and width box
          Display properties: block: takes up 100% of the width and starts on a new line. example p and div tags.
          Inline: doesn't allow you to set a width or height for elemets and start on the same line. ex span and img tags.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h3>Postion:</h3> Static(default): follows noramal flow of the page. Relative: follows normal flow of the page. Lets you position using top, left, bottom, right. Absolute: does not follow the normal flow of the page. Lets you position with top, left, bottom, right. Postions is based off closest 'position: relative' parent.
          Uncommon ones, Fixed: sticks element to a permanent loctaion on the page. Lets you use top, right, bottom, left.
          Sticky: sitck elements to a permaneent location on the page once it hits a threshold.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h3>Media queries:</h3> used to make a web page responsive. Make sure the highest media is at the top in styles sheet
          <ul>Some numbers to remember
            <li>mobile phone: 576px</li>
            <li>Tablet: 768px</li>
            <li>Desktops: 992px</li>
            <li>Large Desktops: 1200px+</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

          <h3>Pseudo selectors in CSS:</h3> after places things after a section/text. Before places things before a section/text. Pseudo element is accessed by ::. Pseudo class is accessed by :
          To add a transition, you only need to add it to the parent element. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <h3>Animations:</h3> create it use @keyframes and then name the animation. Need a starting point 0% and an end point 100%. 
          Staring point needs to either transform at the X or Y axis and add by how many pixels.
          In the parent element you need to add animation: name of animation, how long it last and either infinite(but jumps back to start) or infinite alternate-reverse(continous)
          Without infinite, then just give it a number of how many times you want it to happen and the animation with stop once it reaches that number
        </p>

          <h3>BEM(Block-Element-Modifier):</h3> naming convention used for CSS classes to make them easier to read and understand, easy to maintain and change.
           <ul>
            <li>B [Block] is the block component. example; button, nav, main, footer(name of the massive section) </li>
            <li>E [Element] is dependent on the block component. example; footer, link</li>
            <li>M [Modifier] is used to change the style of the block. example; footer, link visited: not = white, visited = purple</li>
           </ul>
        </p>

      <h2>CSS Notes</h2>
      <p>
        Start with a container<br />
        Display flex: puts elements side by side. But it also unlocks flex-direction, align-items and justify-content.<br />
        <h3>Flex-Direction:</h3> by default its in a row. Set flex-dirction to column if you want coulumns<br />
        <h3>Align-items:</h3> by defult it is stretched to the top and bottom on the container so it uses the vertical axis(cross axis). Main one is align-center, it centers elements vertically.
        flex-end, alings elements to the bottom of container.<br />
        <h3>justify-content:</h3> by default flex-start aligns elements horizontally(main axis). center, puts elements in the center of the container.
        flex-end, puts elements to end of container on the horizontal axis. Space-around makes sure the space between the sides of the container and in between the elements are exactly the same.
        sapce-between, moves elements all the way to the sides and make sure the space between the elements are the same.<br />
        <h3>Using all three: </h3> Flex-direction: column = justify-content becomes <b>vertical</b> axis and align-itmes becomes <b>horizontal</b> axis <br />
        Flex-flow: using flex-dirction and flex-wrap. You can also use calc to push things to differnet lines. For example 6 boxes, 
        width: calc(100% / 3) will only have 3 boxes on a line and push the others to the next line.
      </p>
      <p>
        What does parents and children mean?: 
        <ul>
          <li>Parents refers to any element with other elemets inside it.</li>
          <li>Child refers to an element inside of another element</li>
        </ul>
         Main axis is the horizontal axis. It controls how elements are laid out horizontally. The Cross axis is the vertical axis.
         How the elements are laid out vertically. When using flex box, it is concerned with the parent and then controls how the children
         are laid out.
